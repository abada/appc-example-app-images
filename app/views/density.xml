			<Label class="p small">* The ruler has a fixed width of 100dp, while the image has no width or height set. Only if the device DPI exactly match a generalized category will the image (who's width at mdpi is 100px) be shown in exactly 100dp width. This why you should ALWAYS set the image width or height.</Label>
